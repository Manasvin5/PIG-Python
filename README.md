The Pig game is a simple dice game often used for educational purposes to teach basic probability and decision-making skills. It can be played by two or more players. Here are the basic rules of the game:

    Objective: The first player to reach 100 points or more wins.

    Gameplay:
        Players take turns to roll a single six-sided die as many times as they like.
        The sum of the numbers rolled on a player's turn is added to their turn total.
        A player can choose to hold (stop rolling) and add the turn total to their overall score.

    Risk:
        If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that turn and their turn ends immediately.
        If a player holds, the turn total is added to their overall score, and their turn ends.

    Strategy:
        Players must decide whether to continue rolling to increase their turn total or to hold and secure the points accumulated during the turn, considering the risk of rolling a 1 and losing the turn total.

Example of a Turn:

    Player A's Turn:
        Rolls a 5 (turn total = 5)
        Rolls a 6 (turn total = 11)
        Rolls a 2 (turn total = 13)
        Chooses to hold (adds 13 points to their overall score)

    Player B's Turn:
        Rolls a 4 (turn total = 4)
        Rolls a 1 (turn total = 0, ends turn without adding to the overall score)
